        My name is Adam Kaufman-Frey. Originally, I studied physics and math in my undergrad and worked one summer
        as a research student at TRIUMF, a particle accelerator in Vancouver. After this, I decided I wasn't interested in
        academia and started looking for other pursuits. During my undergrad, I had taken some computer science courses
        and had done some coding in physics courses as well. My job at TRIUMF was doing data analysis in python and matlab
        so I had some experience coding. These experiences showed me that coding involves similar logic and problem solving 
        skills to math and this is how I first became interested in web development. Since then I have enrolled in a web dev 
        bootcamp with edX through the University of Toronto. I've also enjoyed solving leetcode problems on the side as a way 
        to scratch my problem solving itch.
